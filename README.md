Description:
Broken Link Hijacking (BLH) or Link Takeover, 
whatever you called it, the concept is very simple. 
If you get any broken links of any website and 
it’s easy to be taken by someone , 
then it’s a broken link hijacking or takeover bug. 
It’s a similar kind of bug like Subdomain Takeover. 
Just the difference is in subdomain takeover you have 
to takeover the subdomain and in broken link hijacking 
you have to take over the link.


Description: 
This vulnerability in the "change email" feature allows 
attackers to exploit the absence of rate limiting on 
email triggers, enabling them to perform email flooding 
or abuse tactics without restriction.
